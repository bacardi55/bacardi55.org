Hi, 

Today, a short note to indicate some improvement in Kalliopé documentation:

First, a new website has been made. You can find it here: [New Kalliopé website](https://kalliope-project.github.io/). It is a static site generated by [Jekyll](jekyllrb.com/) so anyone can add stuff to it, like neurons, by forking [the github project](https://github.com/kalliope-project/kalliope-project.github.io) and making a pull request :) Great job [Sispheor](https://twitter.com/sispheor)!

As you can see big improvement there! A clean page explaining what kalliopé does with a great example video!

Of course, the most interesting page is the [neuron marketplace](bttps://kalliope-project.github.io/neurons_marketplace.html) ! It clearly shows the available neurons with a nice icon, the link to the repo, and a dedicated page with video demo (with the brain and the template used for the video) for a lot of them! Almost all videos are in French though, but some of them have English subtitle so at least you'll get the idea (:

Here is a list of video I made for the website:

- [Uber neuron](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnb1knix004) (*with english subtile*)
- [Gmaps neuron](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8pi3Puzliw) (*with english subtile*)
- [TodoTxt neuron](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmaspBVd2A) (*with english subtile*)
- [MPD / Mopidy neuron](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zdn7CUQlV1E) (*with english subtile*)
- [repeat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNfpX0MYfFI&list=PLDc8cUmeFkpKdErR5iYTkGJ1-4A05zHIi&index=4) (*with english subtile*)
- [google calendar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xp2cJH2p2s&list=PLDc8cUmeFkpKdErR5iYTkGJ1-4A05zHIi&index=1) (*with english subtile*)
- [web scraper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxjtLvpvEFY&list=PLDc8cUmeFkpKdErR5iYTkGJ1-4A05zHIi&index=3) (*with english subtile*)

More video are to come :)

For the occasion, I've also created a dedicated [Kalliopé page]({% link kalliope.md %}) on this blog, where you can find the videos links, my neurons, scripts and all my kalliopé blog posts.

Stay tune for more cool Kalliopé stuff!
