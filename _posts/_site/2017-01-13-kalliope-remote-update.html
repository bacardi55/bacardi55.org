Hello!

I've already talked about kalliope remote on this blog, my kalliope web JS page to fire synapse remotely. You can find the previous blog posts here.

I've made a quick update to it so that now you can ignore some synapse (and un-ignore them via the "ignored synapse" page).

Update synapse page:
[Click and drag to move]


I still need to work on the parameter part so that this app can fire synapses with arguments.


Stay tuned!
