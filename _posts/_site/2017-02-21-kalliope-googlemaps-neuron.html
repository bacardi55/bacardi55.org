# Introduction

If you follow me on twitter or github, you may have seen this new neuron coming, otherwise, let me introduce to you the [Google Maps neuron](https://github.com/bacardi55/kalliope-gmaps) :)

The goal as you can guess is to leverage the Google Maps API to get direction, distance or direction from an origin point to a destination (it doesn't handle multi origin or destination yet).

# What can you do ?

* Ask for the address of a place (eg: "what is the address of the Eiffel tour")
* Ask for the distance / time between 2 places. (how far is "address A" from "Address B")
  * Ask for the directions between 2 places, on top of distance/time. (how to go from "Address A" to "Address B")

The synapse has a lot of options, so you can set your transportation mode (driving, walking, tube, …), the language, the units system, …
Read the [readme file](https://github.com/bacardi55/kalliope-gmaps/blob/master/README.md) as it contains more information (and more up to date).

# Installation

## Neuron

Usual neuron installation:

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">kalliope install --git-url https://github.com/bacardi55/kalliope-gmaps.git</code></pre></figure>

Will install the neuron and the [google maps services python library)[https://googlemaps.github.io/google-maps-services-python/docs/2.4.5/)

## Synapse

Get the distance and time between 2 locations

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">  - name: <span class="s2">"Gmaps-distance"</span>
    signals:
      - order: <span class="s2">"distance between  and "</span>
    neurons:
      - gmaps:
          gmaps_api_key: <span class="s2">"*********"</span>
          mode: <span class="s2">"driving"</span>
          language: <span class="s2">"en"</span>
          units: <span class="s2">"metric"</span>
          traffic_model: <span class="s2">"pessimistic"</span>
          args:
            - origin
            - destination
          file_template: <span class="s2">"templates/en_gmaps.j2"</span></code></pre></figure>

Get the address of a place by its name

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">  - name: <span class="s2">"Gmaps-place-address"</span>
    signals: 
      - order: <span class="s2">"get address of "</span>
    neurons:
      - gmaps:
          gmaps_api_key: <span class="s2">"******************"</span>
          language: <span class="s2">"en"</span>
          units: <span class="s2">"metric"</span>
          args:
            - search
          file_template: <span class="s2">"templates/en_gmaps.j2"</span></code></pre></figure>

You can find more up to date example on the [github readme page](https://github.com/bacardi55/kalliope-gmaps/blob/master/README.md)

## template

Here is a single template file to handle multiple use cases:

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="gp">{% </span><span class="k">if </span>status <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s2">"KO"</span> %<span class="o">}</span>
    Sorry, but the search didn<span class="s1">'t work, Sir
{% elif status == "OK" %}
    {% if search %}
        {% if origin %}
            Distance between {{ origin }} and {{ search }} is {{ distance }}.
            You need around {{time}} to go there
            {% if time_traffic %}
                You need to plan {{time_traffic}} with the current traffic
            {% endif %}
        {% else %}
            Address of {{search}} is {{destination}}
        {% endif %}
    {% elif destination %}
        Distance between {{oringi}} and {{destination}} is {{distance}}
        You need about {{ time }} to go there.
        {% if time_traffic %}
          Plan {{ time_traffic }} with current traffic.
        {% endif %}
    {% endif %}

    {% if directions %} 
        To go to {{destination}}, you need
        {% for direction in directions %}
            {{ direction }}
        {% endfor %}
    {% endif %}

{% endif %}</span></code></pre></figure>

Of course, you can simplify by splitting it into several templates depending on the arguments you send.


# What's next

Obviously, the Gmaps API is so rich that the possibility for this neuron are limitless… But at least this first version let you do the basics… 

What I have in mind for next updates:

* multi origin / destination
* Leverage more API from google maps

As always, ideas or pull requests are more than welcome!
