# Introduction 

Couple of days ago, I created a very simple neuron to retrieve some system data and have an idea of the system kalliope runs on. It was in the same idea of the [poorsman loganalyser I talked about before](node/31).

In all honesty, most credits goes to [this github repository](https://github.com/edouardpoitras/jasper-status) I found that did almost all the job for me.

# What does it do ?

So far, it returns the following variable that can then be used in a template or say_template:

* running_since 			
* os: OS name
* os_version: Kernel version
* system_name: Name of your host
* system_nb_core: Number of core
* cpu: % of CPU usage
* memory: % of memory usage
* disk: % of disk usage

Look at the [readme](https://github.com/bacardi55/kalliope-system-status) for an up to date list :)

# Installation

The usual:

```bash
kalliope install --git-url https://github.com/bacardi55/kalliope-system-status.git
```

# Usage

Create a brain file like this:

```yaml
  - name: "System-status"
    signals:
      - order: "Step into analysis mode, please"
    neurons:
      - system_status:
          say_template: 
            - "I'm running on , kernel , with  cores.    C P U usage  %  memory usage  %  disk usage  %"
          cache: False
```

Or create a more complex template :)

I'll add more into this, but if you have idea, PR on github or comment on this post :)
