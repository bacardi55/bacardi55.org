Quick note to say I've switched back to static html site, managed (this time) by [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) :).

The reason behind that is simple: it's way easier to maintain and **secure** a stack for html files than php or other :).

And even though I enabled the markdown text format, I still feel more comfortable writing in vim and commiting blog post like code via git (:
